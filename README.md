# BioinformHer_module1
This is the submission for my BioinformHer module1 project.

Mini Project: Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene
It consists of 7 different tasks To apply bioinformatics skills learned in Module 1: download, analyze, and interpret the sequence of the human TNF gene, which encode a proinflammatory cytokine call TNF.

This repos contains a folder including:
-report 
-the sequence file (fasta format)
-the sequence file (PHYLIP format)
